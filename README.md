# Floating Windows

This Windows utility allows you to pick a window via drag-and-drop and set it to be always at top.

![Sample screenshot](sample.png)

Simply drop the crosshair on a window and press the `Float!` button. **Done.**

You don't need to keep this utility running after 'floating' a window. To reverse, repeat the same steps with the  `Unfloat` button.
